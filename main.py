# (10/10 points) You need to setup Django admin and style your models for proper entry.
# No tight restrictions here, just make use of the admin system.

# (5/5 points) There should be a minimum of 5 commits on your project, be sure to commit often!
# (5/5 points) I will be checking out the master branch of your project.
# Please be sure to include a requirements.txt file which contains all the packages that need installed. You can create this fille with the output of pip freeze at the terminal prompt.
# (10/10 points) There should be a README.md file in your project that explains what your project is, how to install the pip requirements, and how to execute the program.
# Please use the GitHub flavor of Markdown. Be thorough on the explanations. You will need to explain the steps of initializing the database and then how to run the development server for your project.

# Remember to run these commands and have them in your README:
# python manage.py makemigrations (this will create any SQL entries that need to go into the database)
# python manage.py migrate (this will apply the migrations)
# python manage.py createsuperuser (this will create the administrator login for your /admin side of your project)
