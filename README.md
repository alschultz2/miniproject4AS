Disclaimer, while I was working on project 4 I had a large issue that came up.
I had a error with my laptop and it turned out that my c-drive was corrupted. 
When I was finally was able to get my drive working again, ane everything reinstalled, my project 4 was completely broken.
No matter how muc I rolled back the project, it would not work anymore, and so I decided to just work on my final project. 

## Description
The goal of this project is to use Django to deploy a small web app of our own choice.
The next goal is to make sure that the small web application meets all of the requirements.

## What my project is about
For my project, I decided I wanted to create a project that would be working with the different monster hunter weapons.
The user would be able to choose what their favorite weapon would be and explain why it is. 

## Pip install instructions
In order to install all of the files necessary for the program,
please run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
By running this line, you should  be able to execute the program with the required files.

## How to run
In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
python main.py
```
Below the command that you enter, you will see in blue hypertext:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
By clicking on it the program will open a webpage for the project. 
Once you are on the webpage, you will simply have to register for an account to be able to see the weapon list.
